#### Summary

My name is Nick and I am an engineer with 4+ years of experience in modern software development. <br>
I have always built a bridge between graphical design and technical implementation, taking an active role on both sides. <br>
I like to build UI with performance, scalability and maintainability in mind. <br>
Likewise, I am looking for a place to share and exchange knowledge. I prefer open-minded and conscious teams. <br>

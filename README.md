### Hello, world!

My name is Nick, and I am an obsessed life-long learner and software enthusiast

I think it is crucial to have strong fundamental knowledge of Computer Science, <br>
Data Structures and Algorithms because it allows you to flexibly move from technology to technology, <br>
while understanding the underlying principles of them. For now, I chose to build web applications <br>
with JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js and modern UI libraries like React.

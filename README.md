In my latest roles, I developed applications with React, TypeScript, and Next.js. <br>
Although I am primarily focused on UI, I also have experience building backend services with Node.js. <br>
I strongly believe that the code we write is meant to be read by other humans, which is why I prioritize sticking <br>
to the Clean Code approach and principles such as KISS, YAGNI, and DRY

### Hello, world!

My name is Nick, and I am an obsessed life-long learner and software enthusiast

I think it is crucial to have strong knowledge of Computer Science fundamentals, <br>
Data Structures and Algorithms and evolution of programming languages, because it allows you to <br>
flexibly move from technology to technology, while understanding the underlying principles. <br>
For now, I chose to build web applications with JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js and modern UI libraries like React.

### Summary

As a software engineer, I have 5 years of experience in modern development. Mainly I <br>
concentrate on frontend, however, I am also competent with backend on Node.js. I prefer to build software <br>
with performance, scalability and maintainability in mind. I am used to active collaboration as well as working <br>
independently. I am looking for a place where I can share and exchange knowledge. Also, I made my <br>
decision long time ago, I choose to work on amazing projects together with amazing people.

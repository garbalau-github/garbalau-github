#### Summary

My name is Nick and I am an engineer with `4+` years of experience in modern software development. <br>
I have always built a bridge between graphical design and technical implementation, taking an active role <br>
on both sides. I like to build UI with `performance`, `scalability` and `maintainability` in mind. <br>
Likewise, I am looking for a place to share and `exchange knowledge`. I prefer open-minded and `conscious` teams.
